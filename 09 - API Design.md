Here are the detailed and verbose notes on API Design:

## Basics of API Design

API design is about controlling the interface of an API, also known as the API contract, which describes how to use a particular API. An API is a service that provides functionality, such as the Twitter API or the Reddit API.

## API Paradigms

There are several API paradigms, including:

- REST (Representational State of Resource)
- RPC (Remote Procedure Call)
- GraphQL

## API Design Principles

When designing an API, we only care about the surface area of the API, not the implementation details. We focus on the interface, what actions can be taken, and what resources are involved.

## CRUD Operations

Most actions in an API can be categorized into CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. These operations are used to interact with resources or entities.

## Entities

Entities are things, such as tweets, users, or comments. They are nouns that represent resources in the API.

## Verbs

Verbs are actions that can be taken on entities, such as create, read, update, or delete. In REST, verbs are represented by HTTP methods (e.g., GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).

## API Endpoints

API endpoints are URLs that define a specific resource or action. They are used to interact with the API.

## Example: Twitter API

Let's consider an example of creating a tweet using the Twitter API. We want to create a tweet with a user ID and a content string. The endpoint could be `POST /tweets` with a JSON body containing the user ID and content.

## Optional Parameters

When designing an API, we need to consider optional parameters. For example, if we want to add a reply feature to the create tweet endpoint, we could add an optional `parent_tweet_id` parameter.

## Backwards Compatibility

When making changes to an API, we need to ensure that existing users are not affected. This means that new parameters should be optional, and existing endpoints should not be changed in a way that breaks existing clients.

## Versioning

To ensure backwards compatibility, APIs often use versioning. This allows multiple versions of the API to coexist, and clients can specify which version they want to use.

## Pagination

When retrieving a large number of resources, we need to use pagination to limit the number of results returned. This is typically done using `limit` and `offset` parameters.

## Query Parameters

Query parameters are used to pass additional information to an endpoint. They are typically used for filtering, sorting, or pagination.

## API Documentation

Good API documentation is essential for users to understand how to use the API. Documentation should include information on endpoints, parameters, and response formats.

## Real-World Examples

Let's take a look at the Twitter API documentation and the Stripe API documentation. These APIs demonstrate good design principles, such as clear endpoint definitions, optional parameters, and pagination.

## Best Practices

When designing an API, we should focus on:

- Backwards compatibility
- Clear endpoint definitions
- Optional parameters
- Pagination
- Good documentation

By following these best practices, we can create APIs that are easy to use and maintain.
