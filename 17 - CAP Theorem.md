Here are the detailed and verbose notes on the CAP Theorem:

## Introduction to CAP Theorem

The CAP Theorem is a popular theorem in the field of distributed systems and databases. However, it is often misunderstood and not as helpful as many people think it is. The theorem relates to distributed databases and applies when we start replicating data.

## Applicability of CAP Theorem

The CAP Theorem only applies to distributed data with replication, such as a leader and follower database. It does not apply to a single database with no replication. Many people try to apply the CAP Theorem to regular SQL databases with a single node and no followers, which is not sensible.

## CAP Theorem Acronym

The CAP Theorem acronym stands for:

- C: Consistency
- A: Availability
- P: Partition Tolerance

## Misconceptions about CAP Theorem

Many people think that the CAP Theorem allows us to choose two out of three options (C, A, or P). However, this is not the actual theorem. Partition Tolerance (P) is always implied and guaranteed. We can only choose between Consistency (C) and Availability (A).

## Partition Tolerance (P)

Partition Tolerance means that our system will continue to function even if our system becomes disconnected in some way. This can happen due to a network partition, where two nodes in our network can't communicate with each other. In this case, we can decide to continue functioning, even if one half of our system can't communicate with the other half.

## Consistency (C)

Consistency means data consistency between the replicated data. Every single read will get the most up-to-date written data. If someone writes data to the leader database and then reads from the leader database, they will get the most up-to-date data. However, if someone reads from the replica database, they may not get the most up-to-date data due to the network partition.

## Availability (A)

Availability means that every single node in our system will respond to valid requests. This does not mean high availability or a certain percentage of requests getting a valid response. It means that every node that did not crash will respond to user requests, even if some nodes have inconsistent data.

## Trade-offs between Consistency and Availability

When we have a partition, we can only choose between Consistency and Availability. We can either make all nodes available for users, even if some have inconsistent data, or we can intentionally stop some nodes from serving users to ensure that all nodes serving users have consistent data.

## Importance of CAP Theorem

The CAP Theorem is important because it highlights the trade-offs we have to make when designing a distributed data storage system. We have to consider what matters more: consistency or availability. In many cases, it's okay to have inconsistent data if we can handle more traffic and serve a larger amount of users.

## P-A-C-E-L-C Theorem

The P-A-C-E-L-C theorem is an extension of the CAP Theorem. It stands for:

- P: Partition (yes or no)
- A: Availability
- C: Consistency
- E: Else (no partition)
- L: Low Latency
- C: Consistency

This theorem highlights the trade-offs we have to make when designing a distributed data storage system. If there is a partition, we can only choose between Availability and Consistency. If there is no partition, we can choose both Consistency and Low Latency.

## Conclusion

The CAP Theorem is a useful tool for understanding the trade-offs we have to make when designing a distributed data storage system. However, it is often misunderstood, and its limitations should be acknowledged. By understanding the CAP Theorem and its extensions, we can make informed decisions about the design of our systems.
